# ðŸš§ Dev Log: LLMs Generator Integration

## âœ… Completed Tasks
- Created `generate_llms.py` to serve as the clean CLI interface
- Refactored `llms_writer.py` with proper formatting, type safety, and address flattening
- Built `.bat` and `.ps1` launchers to support both dev and non-tech user workflows
- Validated integration from YAML input to structured `llms.txt` output
- Set convention for writing `llms.txt` to WordPress site root

## ðŸ§  Insights
- YAML schemas can vary â€” sanitization and defensive logic is key
- LLMs benefit from clean categorization and strong topical linking

## ðŸ”œ Next Session
- Build YAML Builder integration (run generator + receive llms.txt content)
- Enable optional Push to WordPress root directory
- Add preview window in UI for human review before push
